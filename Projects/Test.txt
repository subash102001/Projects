1.Advantages of using react?
---React promotes a predictable flow of data and state management,this predictability leads to more stable and maintainable codebases.
---Modular design is main in the react.
---React uses a syntax extension called JSX, which simplifies HTML markup within JavaScript code
---React provides a set of handy tools that simplify development tasks.
---Developers write to the virtual DOM instead of directly manipulating the actual DOM, resulting in smoother and faster rendering.

2.Types of rest api?
---get api
---post api
---put api
---delete api

3.Difference between use state and use effect?
->use state
---useState is used to declare and update state variables within the component's main function body.
---useState allows functional components to become stateful.
---The useState hook is a function that takes one argument, which is the initial state, and it returns two values: the current state and a function that can be used to update the state.
->us effect
---useEffect is used to perform side effects and is typically defined within the useEffect block, separate from the component's main function body.
---useEffect allows functional components to leverage the component lifecycle hooks which were, in the past, only supported for class components.
---useEffect is more flexible than useState because it does accept a dependency array.

4.Do any of the example with using map?
const userNames = ['subash', 'cody', 'bucky']
function Api() {

  const renderListOfUserNames = (names) => {
    return names.map(name => <li>{name}</li>)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {renderListOfUserNames(userNames)}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Api;

5.Do any example using useEffect?
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

function Effcet() {
    const [counter1,setCounter1]= useState(0)

    useEffect(()=> {
        console.log('use effecr executing')

    },[counter1])
  return (
    <div>
    <h1>{counter1}</h1>
    <button onClick={()=> setCounter1(counter1 + 1)}>Increment 1</button>
    
</div>
  
  )
}

export default Effcet
